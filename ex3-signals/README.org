* Signals

  Signals are the next piece of the Unix puzzle every programmer has to be aware of. It is
  one of the core mechanisms used by Unix-likes for notifying processes of standard
  events, e.g child process termination (the SIGCHLD signal) process or user-requested
  interruption usch as the SIGINT signal (generated using the Ctrl-C character).
