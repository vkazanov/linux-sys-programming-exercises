* Using Strace to trace system calls on Linux

  Unix-like systems isolate user programs from hardware using the system call system. In
  this set of exercises we'll use strace to study system calls issued by the example
  programs.

  Notice that system calls are not the same as library wrappers defined in glibc. Most
  Unix-related standards cover functions and function-like macros but not system calls
  directly. What this practically means is that reading strace output can lead to
  interesting discoveries.

  The Linux Programming Interface is also a very useful book.
